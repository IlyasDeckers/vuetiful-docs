# Creating plugins
Plugins can be created on the fly and are installed automatically as `$pluginName` for your convenience. These plugins are base templates that can be used to quickly create plugins for your application.
```js
npm run new plugin
```
If you would like to place the plugin in a subfolder of `/plugins` then use this naming convention on generation: `folder_name/plugin_name`
